1: grad, persp, conv, max-pool

2: 640 * 480 = 307200
   640 * 480 * 3 = 921600

3: It utilizes a more robust distance metric, rather than simple Euclidean distance used in k-means method

4: To undo pooling by outputting an image with larger resolution (i.e., pixels in spatial directions)

5: We use ‘bed of nails’: output the maximal values in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere
   We output maximal values at their respective indexes (called max location switches) and place zeroes elsewhere

6: A matrix produced by computing dot product between two sets of vectors

7: It produces data that is hard to distinguish from real
